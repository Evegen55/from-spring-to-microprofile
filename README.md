# This project is an illustration for the "Eclipse MicroProfile for Spring Boot developers" blog post        
This repository consists of two projects, one written in Spring Boot - in the `spring-boot` 
directory and one written in MicroProfile, in the `microprofile` directory

To build either of the projects, run `mvn clean install` in the project's directory.
To run them, use: `java -jar target/*.jar`.

The projects are based on:
- https://github.com/thorntail-examples/configmap
- https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-configmap-booster
